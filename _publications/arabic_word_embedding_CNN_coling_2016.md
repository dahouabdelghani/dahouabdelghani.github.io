In this paper, a scheme of Arabic sentiment classification, which evaluates and detects the sentiment polarity from Arabic
reviews and Arabic social media, is studied.  We investigated in several architectures to build a quality neural word embeddings using a 3.4 billion words corpus from a collected 10 billion words web-crawled corpus.   Moreover,  a convolutional neural network trained on top of pre-trained Arabic word embeddings is used for sentiment classification to evaluate the quality of these word embeddings.
